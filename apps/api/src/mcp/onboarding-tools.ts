const SHARED_PREAMBLE = `Autonoma runs your end-to-end tests against a preview deployment of your app. These tools let a coding agent do the whole of onboarding while the user watches read-only in the Autonoma UI. This is the only Autonoma MCP you need for onboarding; there is a separate one for reviewing pull requests later.

An app gets its previews one of two ways, and they need completely different work from you:
- **Autonoma-hosted** - Autonoma builds and hosts a preview per pull request. You write the build, services and env config here and deploy through these tools.
- **Their own pipeline** - the project already builds previews. Autonoma deploys NOTHING; you connect those previews so Autonoma knows when one is live.
Do not guess which one: pair(code) returns \`previewSource\` and the full playbook for it. Follow the playbook it gives you.

On their own pipeline there are two ways Autonoma learns a preview is live, and the playbook you get names which applies - do not assume the webhook. If the project is on **Vercel**, Autonoma's Marketplace integration reports deployments already, and the work is connecting the project (get_vercel_setup); hand-writing a signed webhook there produces previews Autonoma cannot even reach, because linking the project is also what applies the deployment-protection bypass. Every other host is the signed webhook (get_signal_setup).

**Autonoma-hosted is the default. Their own pipeline is the exception, and it takes an explicit request from the user.** Two reasons, and neither is something you can settle by reading the repo:
- **Where test data lands.** An Autonoma-hosted preview gets its own database, so a run creates and destroys data in an environment nothing else shares. Their own previews point at a real database - commonly staging, sometimes production - so a run writes into it, and anything it creates that no tenant owns STAYS there. Picture a marketplace with no per-preview database: a test run creates listings, and real users see them.
- **What Autonoma can see.** On their pipeline Autonoma builds nothing, verifies nothing and holds no build or app logs, so when a preview is broken there is nothing to debug it with. On Autonoma-hosted previews all of that exists.
**Their own pipeline always takes the user's own decision** - select_preview_path refuses it without their words. What changes by app is whether you should RAISE it:
- **On Vercel** (Autonoma's integration is there, so it is a genuine choice): ask. It fits when the previews are entirely Vercel's - the backend in the same deployable unit, and either data cleanly scoped to a tenant a teardown can delete whole, or a branchable database (Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale) giving each preview its own. A backend deployed elsewhere, or global tables a tenant teardown would leak into, means Autonoma-hosted - which plenty of Vercel projects choose deliberately.
- **Anywhere else**: do not bring it up. Pick Autonoma-hosted and carry on. If the USER asks ("can't we just use our previews?"), explain both sides - theirs is less to change, but test data lands in whatever database those previews point at and a failure leaves us no logs - then pass their answer.
A deploy workflow in the repo is NOT evidence for any of this: a YAML file cannot tell you whether those previews work, whether they are isolated, or which database they point at - so finding one is never a reason to pick.

Start every session by pairing - and pair FIRST, before you analyze the repo, read files, or plan. Pairing is low-risk: it only claims the app's config so the UI can show you are connected, it changes NO code and deploys NOTHING, and the user can take over at any time. This matters because the user is watching the Autonoma UI live and sees no activity at all until you pair - pairing is what flips the UI into "your agent is connected and configuring" and starts streaming what you do as feedback. If you spend minutes inspecting the project before pairing, the user just stares at an idle screen with no idea anything is happening (and may give up). So do NOT front-load repo analysis; pair immediately, then investigate.
1. The user starts onboarding in the Autonoma UI and clicks "Configure with coding agent". The UI shows a short pairing CODE.
2. Call pair(code) with it IMMEDIATELY, as your very first action - then do any repo analysis you need. That claims the app for you and returns its applicationId, how it gets its previews, and the playbook to follow. Use that applicationId for every other tool.
3. CHECK YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT REPO. pair returns \`repository\` - the repo this app is linked to. Confirm your working directory is that repo (\`git remote get-url origin\`) BEFORE you read a single file. An agent run from the wrong checkout will happily analyze an unrelated codebase and pick a path from evidence that has nothing to do with the app. If it does not match, stop and tell the user rather than guessing.
4. If pair reports \`previewSource: "not-chosen-yet"\`, call select_preview_path with \`autonoma-hosted\` and tell the user that is what you picked. That is the default and it is safe: the worst case is a preview Autonoma builds for them anyway. It changes only if the user chooses their own deploys, in which case pass their words in \`userRequest\`. On Vercel you may ask them; anywhere else do not raise it unless they do. This is the opposite of the rest of onboarding, where you should read the code rather than make the user self-assess - here the deciding facts (does that pipeline work, what database does it point at, do they want us in it) are not in the code.

Every playbook is also readable on demand, without pairing, so a long session that has pushed one out of context can re-read it instead of guessing: \`autonoma://autonoma-hosted-playbook\`, \`autonoma://vercel-playbook\`, \`autonoma://own-pipeline-playbook\`. Read the one pair() named, not the one you remember.

Control: you hold the config while you work; the UI is read-only. If get_session_status (or any write) reports the user took over (standDown / paused), STOP configuring and let them - do not fight for control. They can hand it back with "Resume with Claude" and you re-claim on your next call. If you go idle for a while the UI hands control back automatically; just resume when the user asks.`;

/** Autonoma builds the preview, so the build/service/env config lives here. */
const PREVIEWKIT_PLAYBOOK = `This app uses **Autonoma-hosted previews**: Autonoma builds and hosts them, so the build, services, env and deploy all go through these tools.

Your tools here: get_config, apply_config, request_env, trigger_deploy, wait_for_deploy, get_session_status, get_target_logs, go_live. The signal tools (get_signal_setup, get_signal_status, confirm_signal_setup) are for apps on their own pipeline and do not apply - ignore them.

Loop until the preview is up:
1. get_config(applicationId) - read the current preview config.
2. apply_config(applicationId, document) - save the FULL config document (call get_config first, edit it, send the whole thing back). It is validated on save; if invalid, the error tells you what to fix.
3. If the app needs secret env values (third-party API keys, tokens) you do NOT have: call request_env(applicationId, keys), then keep polling get_session_status (step 5) until the request clears - that poll is the only thing that tells you the values landed. NEVER put secret values in any tool call - you cannot, there is no tool that takes them. The user enters them in the Autonoma UI. ALWAYS ask the user first whether to set env on Autonoma from their .env (the default, they paste it into the UI) or configure them manually. Never request AUTONOMA_* variables (AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT, AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_PR, AUTONOMA_PREVIEWKIT_URL, AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET, AUTONOMA_SIGNING_SECRET) - Autonoma injects all of them automatically and rejects attempts to set them. Non-secret config (e.g. NODE_ENV) belongs in apply_config as an app connection, and so does the URL of a service that lives INSIDE the preview (its own Postgres, Redis, ...) - that URL only exists at deploy time, so wire it as a connection instead of asking the user for it.
4. WORK ON AN INTEGRATION BRANCH, then trigger_deploy(applicationId). Getting a preview to build usually takes real commits - a Dockerfile that was never built from a repo root, a missing build arg - and none of that belongs on the user's default branch unproven. So do NOT deploy the default branch and do NOT ask the user which branch to use. Cut one, off the DEFAULT branch, whose name pair() returns as \`defaultBranch\` - never assume it is called "main":
   \`git fetch origin && git switch --create ${INTEGRATION_BRANCH} origin/<defaultBranch>\`
   Two cases first: if the working tree has uncommitted changes they are the user's, so branch off the current HEAD instead and leave them out of your commits; if a branch from an earlier session already exists (or you are on it), stay there rather than cutting a second one.
   Then PUSH IT (\`git push --set-upstream origin ${INTEGRATION_BRANCH}\`) BEFORE you name it - apply_config verifies the branch against GitHub and refuses one that isn't there yet. Set it with apply_config's \`branch\` field (that does NOT deploy on its own), then trigger_deploy. The base preview follows that branch from then on, so every fix you push rebuilds it. At the end it reaches the default branch the way any other change does: as a pull request the user reviews.
5. Waiting comes in two flavours, and they use different tools.
   WAITING FOR THE DEPLOY: wait_for_deploy(applicationId) - it BLOCKS server-side until the deploy reaches a terminal state and returns the outcome. Use it; do not hand-roll sleeps or a polling loop. It returns \`in_progress\` when its budget runs out: call it again - a first build routinely runs for ten minutes or more (impact analysis, then a build node, then the image), so "this is taking a while" is not evidence anything is wrong. \`idle\` means nothing was deploying at all - stop and read \`queued\` from your trigger_deploy response to see whether anything was ever started, rather than deploying again on reflex.
   NEVER call trigger_deploy again to check on or hurry a deploy that is already running. A second request does not queue behind the first, it CANCELS it - so a retry throws away the very build you were waiting for and starts the clock over. trigger_deploy now refuses to do that: while a deploy is in flight it starts nothing and returns \`started: false, declined: "already_in_flight"\` with the running deploy's status. Treat that as "go back to wait_for_deploy", not as an error to work around. Deploy again only once the deploy in flight has SETTLED, or - when you have pushed a fix the running build predates and genuinely want to abandon it - with \`force: true\`.
   WAITING FOR THE USER: get_session_status(applicationId) - after request_env there is nothing to block on, because the user answers in the Autonoma UI and only this call reports it. So poll it, roughly every 30s, for as long as it takes - a user can be several minutes away from a key they have to go dig up. A quiet chat means nothing either way. (If they do say they are done, poll once to pick it up and carry on.) When the request clears, check lastEnvResolution: the user may have SKIPPED keys they don't have (skippedKeys) - adapt the config to live without them (default, drop, or rework) instead of re-requesting.
   get_session_status also carries the deploy status, preview URL, diagnostics and your control state, so it stays the right call for "where is everything at" - it is only the WAITING that belongs to wait_for_deploy.
6. A ready status only means the app's port is accepting connections - it does NOT mean the app works. Before declaring the preview done, verify it yourself: exercise the main flow against the preview URL (curl it, or a small Playwright script if the user has Playwright - log in, load data, hit a few real routes), then call get_session_status again and READ the app's runtime logs in recentLogs. If the logs show the app erroring behind a ready status (crashed queries, missing env, stack traces), fix the cause and redeploy. If you cannot exercise the flow yourself, ask the user to click through the app once and then read the logs.
7. go_live(applicationId) - take the app live once you have verified the preview. Until you do, Autonoma reviews no pull requests and holds back the comments it would have posted. Do this as soon as the preview is good; the SDK handler and the scenario recipes below carry on afterwards and this never waits on them.

Which app hosts the Autonoma SDK: set \`sdk_implemented: true\` on the app whose code serves the Environment Factory handler - every scenario up/down is sent there. Set it on exactly one app, in the same apply_config call as the rest of the topology, as soon as you know where the handler lives. It is INDEPENDENT of \`primary\`: a full-stack app (Next.js, Rails, Django) is both the app the agents browse and the SDK host, so it carries both flags; a split topology marks the frontend \`primary\` and the API service \`sdk_implemented\`. Leave it unset and Autonoma falls back to the primary app, which makes every up 404 when the handler actually lives on another service.

Where on that app the handler is mounted: \`sdk_path\` on the SAME app, when it is not the conventional \`/api/autonoma\`. Read the route the handler is actually registered at in the repo and set it verbatim (leading slash, no host, no query) - e.g. \`sdk_path: "/autonoma"\`. Set it even when the route IS \`/api/autonoma\` - an explicit path is what makes the endpoint independent of the convention, and Autonoma only assumes that path for an app that declares none (older documents nobody has revisited). Set it BEFORE validate_sdk: that call is what stores the endpoint, and pointed at the wrong path it fails with the app's own 404.

Connections wire env vars to the preview's own topology, resolved at deploy time - services do NOT auto-inject anything into apps. If an app needs to reach a database/service declared in this config, you MUST add a connection on that app. The value is a template: {{name.property}} tokens reference apps/services by name. For a service, {{db.url}} is the full canonical connection string (postgres -> postgresql://preview:preview@<host>:<port>/preview) - prefer it; {{db.host}} / {{db.port}} exist for hand-built URLs. For an app, {{api.url}} is its public HTTPS URL. {{pr}}, {{namespace}} and {{owner}} are also available. Example: apps[].connections = [{ "key": "DATABASE_URL", "value": "{{db.url}}" }].`;

 */
const EXTERNAL_DEPLOYS_PLAYBOOK = `This app uses **its own pipeline** for previews: the project already builds them. Autonoma deploys NOTHING here, and there is no build config to write. Your job is to make their pipeline tell Autonoma when a preview is live, then prove it worked.

1. get_signal_setup(applicationId) - returns the endpoint, the applicationId, the shared secret, the exact body + signature contract, and a starter GitHub Actions workflow. Treat that workflow as a TEMPLATE, not a requirement: it hangs off GitHub's \`deployment_status\` event, which many pipelines never emit. READ how this project actually deploys (its CI config, its host) and make the same signed call from whatever step knows a preview is live - a deploy job, a post-deploy script, the host's own webhook.
2. Wire it into the repo, conventionally on a branch + PR so the user reviews it rather than you pushing to main. Two things to get right: sign the EXACT bytes you POST (re-serializing the JSON after signing changes the digest and the call is rejected), and put the shared secret in the pipeline's secret store (e.g. \`gh secret set AUTONOMA_SHARED_SECRET\`) rather than committing it.
3. On a pull-request deploy, send \`branch\` and \`prNumber\` TOGETHER - that is what turns a signal into a per-PR review. A signal carrying neither is recorded as a main-branch deploy. A signal carrying \`branch\` but NOT \`prNumber\` is IGNORED entirely, so never send one without the other.
4. If one pull request deploys several services (frontend, API, database), signal only the one Autonoma should browse. Every signal overwrites the stored preview URL, so signalling all of them means whichever deploy finishes last wins - and that may be the API rather than the frontend.
5. get_signal_status(applicationId) - poll until \`signalReceived\` is true. That is the ONLY confirmation the wiring works. Prove it with a real run of their pipeline (push the branch, let it deploy) rather than a hand-written curl: a curl you wrote proves your curl works, not that their pipeline calls us.
6. confirm_signal_setup(applicationId) - once a signal has landed, mark setup done so onboarding advances.
7. go_live(applicationId) - take the app live. Until you do, Autonoma records preview URLs but reviews no pull requests. This one goes live on trust: Autonoma cannot verify your wiring reviews per-PR until a real PR signal arrives, so open a pull request afterwards and check get_signal_status reports \`prReviewsConfirmed\`.

\`prReviewsConfirmed\` in get_signal_status turns true the first time a signal arrives carrying a prNumber. Until that happens the app records preview URLs but never reviews a pull request, so do not call the wiring finished on a main-branch signal alone.

Your tools here: get_signal_setup, get_signal_status, confirm_signal_setup, go_live, plus the scenario/recipe tools once a preview URL exists.

There is no config to write, no deploy to trigger and no build logs to read: apply_config, trigger_deploy, request_env and get_target_logs only apply to Autonoma-hosted previews and will refuse if you call them here.`;

/** SDK endpoint + scenario recipes - identical once a preview URL exists, whichever path produced it. */
const SDK_AND_RECIPES = `The SDK (environment factory): once the preview is up, the app needs ONE POST endpoint - conventionally \`/api/autonoma\`, and any other route works as long as the config's \`sdk_path\` names it - that creates and tears down a scenario's test data. The user implements it in their repo - conventionally on a PR titled "feat: autonoma-sdk", so they iterate on a branch instead of pushing to main - and every preview of that PR is its own environment. On Vercel, make that branch BEFORE you pick the deployment onboarding points at, not after: Vercel builds a preview for every branch pushed, and that preview is the only one that will contain the handler, so pointing onboarding at it means never having to re-point it later (and a fresh build already carries the injected shared secret, so nothing needs rebuilding). The Vercel playbook's step 4 is this same instruction from the other side. list_dry_run_targets(applicationId) lists them (the base \`main\` preview plus each open PR) and flags the one auto-detected as the SDK PR; work against that target, not against main. Then validate_sdk(applicationId, target) calls the handler's \`discover\` and stores the schema it returns - do this before any dry run. When it fails, the returned error is the handler's own; get_target_logs(applicationId, target, source:"app") is where the stack trace behind it lives. A 404 with no app log line is the one exception - nothing was reached, so the endpoint is at another path: fix \`sdk_path\` with apply_config and validate again. Note that get_session_status ONLY ever reports the base preview, so on this phase it tells you nothing about the PR you are validating - use list_dry_run_targets for that target's deploy state and get_target_logs for its output.

Scenario recipes (test data): a scenario is a named app state a test depends on (e.g. "logged-in admin with one open invoice"); its recipe is the JSON your deployed Autonoma SDK follows to create those entities in the app's OWN database at test time. Before onboarding finishes the recipe often does not work yet, so fix it here: list_scenarios(applicationId) shows the app's scenarios and which already have a recipe; get_recipe(scenarioId) reads one; update_recipe(scenarioId, recipe) saves a corrected version (the recipe's \`name\` must stay the scenario's name - this EDITS an existing scenario, it does not create one; the recipe shape is validated on save and an invalid one is rejected with the exact bad field paths, so read them and resend); dry_run_scenario(scenarioId, recipe?) runs a recipe end-to-end against the deployed app (calls the SDK \`up\` to create the entities, then \`down\` to tear them back down) and, on failure, returns which phase failed (recipe/up/down) and the SDK's error - pass your edited \`recipe\` to try it WITHOUT storing it, which is how you iterate. This needs the app deployed with its SDK URL + signing secret configured, so get the preview up first. A scaled-to-zero preview 503s on the first call while it wakes; dry_run_scenario rides through that warm-up automatically, so give the first run ~a minute before concluding anything is wrong (and if it still comes back with a cold-start/503, just call it again - it is waking).

How to iterate on a failing recipe - first tell apart the TWO things that can be wrong, because they iterate very differently. (1) The recipe JSON (a bad \`create\` graph, a wrong field, a \`_ref\` matching no \`_alias\`): iterate with dry_run_scenario(scenarioId, recipe) - it provisions your candidate without storing it, so the app keeps working off its current recipe while you experiment, and a wrong guess costs nothing. The recipe lives on Autonoma, so each attempt takes effect with NO redeploy. When one passes, re-run it with \`save: true\` (or call update_recipe) to make it the active recipe; do NOT save a recipe you have not seen pass. (2) The app's SDK handler code that interprets the recipe and writes to the database (a missing factory for a model, a broken insert): that lives in the app's repo and only changes when the app is REBUILT, and its thrown errors land in get_target_logs(target, source:"app") - read them before guessing. Commit the fix and push it to the branch whose preview you are testing: if you are working a target from list_dry_run_targets, that is the SDK PR's branch, and pushing to it redeploys that preview on its own. If instead you are on the base preview, push to \`deployBranch\` (returned by get_config / pair) and call trigger_deploy to rebuild it, polling get_session_status until it is \`ready\` again. Either way wait for the redeploy BEFORE you dry_run - against a preview that is still building you would just be testing the old code (list_dry_run_targets reports each target's availability). Fastest of all: iterate the SDK handler and recipe LOCALLY first - run the app's Autonoma SDK against a local server + database, exercise the recipe, and confirm the rows actually landed in the DB - then push/update only once it works. A local loop is seconds; a cloud rebuild is minutes.`;
